  there are no restrictions on the functions\' return values
     (they can even return promises),

  functions have built-in access to all prior functions\' return values
     (or resolution values when promises are returned),

  there is just one restriction on the arguments that functions can accept: 
     Only one argument is allowed. That is because functions operate on the 
     return values of previous functions. This is not a limitation on 
     possibilities since multiple values can be returned in arrays, sets, etc.
