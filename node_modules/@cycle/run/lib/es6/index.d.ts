/**
 * A function that prepares the Cycle application to be executed. Takes a `main`
 * function and prepares to circularly connects it to the given collection of
 * driver functions. As an output, `setup()` returns an object with three
 * properties: `sources`, `sinks` and `run`. Only when `run()` is called will
 * the application actually execute. Refer to the documentation of `run()` for
 * more details.
 *
 * **Example:**
 * ```js
 * import {setup} from '@cycle/run';
 * const {sources, sinks, run} = setup(main, drivers);
 * // ...
 * const dispose = run(); // Executes the application
 * // ...
 * dispose();
 * ```
 *
 * @param {Function} main a function that takes `sources` as input and outputs
 * `sinks`.
 * @param {Object} drivers an object where keys are driver names and values
 * are driver functions.
 * @return {Object} an object with three properties: `sources`, `sinks` and
 * `run`. `sources` is the collection of driver sources, `sinks` is the
 * collection of driver sinks, these can be used for debugging or testing. `run`
 * is the function that once called will execute the application.

/**
 * A partially-applied variant of setup() which accepts only the drivers, and
 * allows many `main` functions to execute and reuse this same set of drivers.
 *
 * Takes an object with driver functions as input, and outputs an object which
 * contains the generated sources (from those drivers) and a `run` function
 * (which in turn expects sinks as argument). This `run` function can be called
 * multiple times with different arguments, and it will reuse the drivers that
 * were passed to `setupReusable`.
 *
 * **Example:**
 * ```js
 * import {setupReusable} from '@cycle/run';
 * const {sources, run, dispose} = setupReusable(drivers);
 * // ...
 * const sinks = main(sources);
 * const disposeRun = run(sinks);
 * // ...
 * disposeRun();
 * // ...
 * dispose(); // ends the reusability of drivers
 * ```

 * @param {Object} drivers an object where keys are driver names and values
 * are driver functions.
 * @return {Object} an object with three properties: `sources`, `run` and
 * `dispose`. `sources` is the collection of driver sources, `run` is the
 * function that once called with 'sinks' as argument, will execute the
 * application, tying together sources with sinks. `dispose` terminates the
 * reusable resources used by the drivers. Note also that `run` returns a
 * dispose function which terminates resources that are specific (not reusable)
 * to that run.
