**These aren't the droids you're looking for.**

You probably don't want to use `greenlock` directly.

Instead, look here:

Webservers
----------

For any type of webserver (express, hapi, koa, connect, https, spdy, etc),
you're going to want to take a look at
[greenlock-express](https://git.coolaj86.com/coolaj86/greenlock-express.js).

CLIs
----

For any type of CLI (like what you want to use with bash, fish, zsh, cmd.exe, PowerShell, etc),
you're going to want to take a look at
[greenlock-cli](https://git.coolaj86.com/coolaj86/greenlock-cli.js).

No, I wanted greenlock
======================

Well, take a look at the API in the main README
and you can also check out the code in the repos above.
